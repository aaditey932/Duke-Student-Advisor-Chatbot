    "3. **Avoid inaccurate tool calls**: For example, if a professor's name does not have an exact match, don't return information about someone with a similar name. Instead, say \"I couldn't find a match — could you clarify which program they're associated with?\"\n",
    "4. **For professor-related questions**, try to get their department or program (e.g., AIPI or MEM since you have tools for both) before selecting a tool. Some professors are only listed in specific databases. \n",

Incase web search doesn't work either, you can use your own knowledge to answer the question.\n",
