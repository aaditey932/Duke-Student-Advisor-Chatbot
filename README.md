### 7. **AIPI Program Details** (`get_AIPI_details`)
- **Primary tool** for Artificial Intelligence for Product Innovation program
- Comprehensive coverage of program overview, curriculum, admissions, faculty
- Uses advanced Pinecone retrieval with document reconstruction

### 8. **Web Search** (`web_search`)
- **Fallback tool** for Duke-specific queries not covered by specialized tools
- Custom Google Search implementation with content extraction
- Used for recent developments, student organizations, policies

### 9. **Final Answer** (`final_answer`)
- **Required final step** for all conversations
- Ensures proper response formatting and tool tracking
